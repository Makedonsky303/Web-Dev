    <p>The two most common display values are block and inline.</p>

    <p>
        A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available
An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary
The "div" element is a block-level element and is often used as a container for other HTML elements
The "span" element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document
