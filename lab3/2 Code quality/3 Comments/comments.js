// An important sign of a good developer is comments: 
// their presence and even their absence.

// Good comments allow us to maintain the code well, 
// come back to it after a delay and use it more effectively.

// Comment this:

// Overall architecture, high-level view.
// Function usage.
// Important solutions, especially when not immediately obvious.

// Avoid comments:

// That tell “how code works” and “what it does”.
// Put them in only if it’s impossible to make the code so simple and 
// self-descriptive that it doesn’t require them.
